# Stage 1.5: Inference Rules Engine - Implementation Report

**Date:** 2025-01-23
**Phase:** Phase 1 v1.2 - Stage 1.5
**Source:** p.md 5.1 Inference Rules Specification

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented **4 ontological inference rules** (p.md 5.1) to enhance the HVDC v3.0 network with intelligent relationship detection. The inference engine generated **70 inferred edges** across **3 relationship types**, increasing network connectivity by **65.5%** (from 107 to 177 edges).

## Implementation Details

### Rule 1: Transitive Property (indirectly_serves)

**Logic:**
```
IF Vessel :operates_from MOSB AND MOSB :dispatches Site
THEN Vessel :indirectly_serves Site
```

**Results:**
- Generated edges connecting vessels to sites through MOSB
- Edge type: `indirectly_serves`
- Weight: 0.3 (lower than direct connections)

### Rule 2: Cargo Flow Path (flows_through)

**Logic:**
```
IF Vessel :operates_from MOSB AND Port :feeds_into MOSB
THEN Vessel :flows_through Port
```

**Results:**
- Generated edges connecting vessels to HVDC ports
- Edge type: `flows_through`
- Weight: 0.4
- Enables tracing cargo flow from port to vessel

### Rule 3: Critical Path Detection (criticality)

**Logic:**
```
IF Operation :performed_by Person AND Person :operates Vessel AND Vessel :operates_from MOSB
THEN Operation.criticality = HIGH (depth >= 3)
```

**Results:**
- **9 critical operations** identified
- Operations marked with `criticality: "HIGH"` and `dependency_depth` attribute
- Helps prioritize high-risk operations

### Rule 4: Co-Location Clustering (co_located_with)

**Logic:**
```
IF Vessel_A :operates_from Location AND Vessel_B :operates_from Location
THEN Vessel_A :co_located_with Vessel_B
```

**Results:**
- Generated edges connecting vessels operating from the same location
- Edge type: `co_located_with`
- Weight: 0.2
- Useful for resource sharing and conflict detection

## Network Statistics

### Before Inference Rules
- Total Nodes: 50
- Total Edges: **107**
- Edge Types: 11 (structural relationships)

### After Inference Rules
- Total Nodes: 50 (no change)
- Total Edges: **177** (+70 inferred edges, **+65.5%**)
- Edge Types: **14** (+3 new types)
- Inferred Edges: **70**
- Critical Operations: **9**

### Edge Type Breakdown

**Original Types (11):**
1. `belongs_to`
2. `connected_to`
3. `dispatches`
4. `feeds_into`
5. `governed_by`
6. `hosts`
7. `operates`
8. `operates_from`
9. `performed`
10. `same_as`
11. `uses`

**Inferred Types (3):**
1. `co_located_with` - Vessels at same location
2. `flows_through` - Cargo flow path
3. `indirectly_serves` - Transitive service relationships

## Network Connectivity

### MOSB Hub
- **Incoming edges:** 4 (from Ports + flows_through)
- **Outgoing edges:** 14 (to Sites + vessels + parties)
- **Centrality:** High (acts as main distribution hub)

### Average Degree
- **Before:** ~4.3
- **After:** **7.08**
- **Improvement:** +64.7%

### Inferred Edge Distribution

1. **indirectly_serves**: Vessel→Site connections (majority)
2. **flows_through**: Vessel→Port connections
3. **co_located_with**: Vessel→Vessel connections

## Critical Operations Analysis

**9 critical operations identified** with dependency depth ≥ 3:

These operations have complex dependency chains:
- Operation → Person → Vessel → MOSB
- Any disruption in these chains has cascading effects
- Recommended for enhanced monitoring and backup planning

## Ontology Compliance

### Ontology Classes (6 types)
- `Asset` (Vessels, Equipment)
- `Location` (Ports, Hub, Sites)
- `Party` (Persons, Organizations)
- `Process` (Operations)
- `Project` (Root)
- `System` (Subsystems)

### Relationship Types (14 types)
- **Structural:** belongs_to, connected_to
- **Operational:** dispatches, feeds_into, operates, operates_from, performed, uses
- **Organizational:** governed_by, hosts
- **Semantic:** same_as
- **Inferred:** co_located_with, flows_through, indirectly_serves

## Validation Results

## Performance Metrics

### Network Density
- **Density:** Increased from ~8.7% to ~14.4%
- **Connectivity:** Improved by 65.5%

### Query Performance
- Inference rules add **minimal overhead** (<100ms)
- All rules executed in single pass
- Edge checking prevents duplicates

## Use Cases Enabled

### 1. Cargo Flow Tracing
- **Query:** "Which vessels can serve Site X?"
- **Answer:** Follow `indirectly_serves` edges from vessels to sites

### 2. Critical Operation Monitoring
- **Query:** "Which operations are critical?"
- **Answer:** Filter by `criticality: "HIGH"`

### 3. Resource Sharing
- **Query:** "Which vessels are co-located?"
- **Answer:** Follow `co_located_with` edges

### 4. Port-Vessel Connections
- **Query:** "Which ports does Vessel X flow through?"
- **Answer:** Follow `flows_through` edges from vessel to ports

## Next Steps

### Stage 2 Enhancements
1. **SPARQL Query Interface** (p.md 5.2)
   - Implement SPARQL endpoint for graph queries
   - Enable complex relationship queries

2. **Real-Time Updates** (p.md 5.3)
   - Incremental inference rule application
   - Event-driven graph updates

3. **Advanced Inference** (p.md 5.1)
   - Temporal relationships (before/after)
   - Capacity constraints (vessel capacity)
   - Regulatory compliance (permit dependencies)
