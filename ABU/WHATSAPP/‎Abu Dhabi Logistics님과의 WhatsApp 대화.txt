Although i'm unsure who was last person to leave yesterday, i kindly request that everyone be more deligent about : 

1. Proper locking the office door
2. Switching off all lights before leaving 
3. Ensuring the office is secure at the end of the workday. 

Please be mindful above to maintain office security. 

Thanks

Recently, we have encountered multiple cases where the quantity of materials arriving at DAS Island does not match the figures stated in the LPO. This has led to challenges from top management, particularly during the re-purchasing process.

To prevent such issues, we kindly request that you double-check all material quantities during stuffing to ensure accuracy and alignment with the LPO.

 -  Inland transportation/offloading at Laydown
 - Insufficient crane ( East Harbor can operate 2 vessels at a once but due to non-availability of crane only 1 vessel is operating with 400T fixed crane which can affect our vessels operation. their 145T crane is engaged with drilling team, it used to operate in East Harbor, only 100T crane available its also frequently breakdown, due to non-availability of crane they are unable to collect the backload and shift our inbound materials as well. I'm trying sent basket with forklift but no jetty space at East Harbor, full of inbound shipment.

25/8/21 AM 10:32 - DaN: Buddy @‚Å®ronpap20‚Å© 

Please refer to below proposal to minimize the idle time of Crane (we discussed it to Mr. Lakhveer)

*For UPC Deliveries (if 2x Trips per Trailer)*

* First delivery Trailer should be positioned at offloading location then cut engine.
* Engine Head should Collect 2nd delivery and come back to MOSB to complete the offloading process.

Mr. Lakhveer from UPC has agreed to this approach.
25/8/21 AM 10:37 - ÏÉÅÏö±: Cost charge..forward to PCM
25/8/21 AM 10:37 - ronpap20: Noted.as always we do. But today tje crane is ready on time and it takes only 30min for 2 trailers offloading. As per driver they came back again but entry pass was delay so please if ever we  plan for 2nd trip we must be aware and take entry pass ready. Thanks
