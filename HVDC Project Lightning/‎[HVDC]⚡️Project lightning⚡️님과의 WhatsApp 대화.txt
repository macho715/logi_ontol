24/9/27 AM 8:14 - 국일 Kim: one of the vehicles has bead connected to the trailer but the other two trailers do not have heads, so they will need to be unloaded via LOLO or RORO.
24/9/27 AM 8:14 - 국일 Kim: Please confirm how the unloading process will be handled at DAS if sent in this condition. <This message was edited>
24/9/27 AM 8:17 - Ramaju Das: Ok sir
24/9/27 AM 8:18 - Ramaju Das: All HCS will be offloaded by sling belt and after that we will do RORO for one Falcor trailer
24/9/27 AM 8:19 - 국일 Kim: noted
24/9/27 AM 8:19 - Ramaju Das: And sir please send webbing sling with HCS ….. I mean please send pre sling condition
24/9/27 AM 8:20 - 국일 Kim: the sides of the HCS are a bit sharp,
24/9/27 AM 8:21 - 국일 Kim: but is it still possible to use our webbing sling withouth addtional protection?
24/9/27 AM 8:21 - Ramaju Das: I have packing protection sir for that…. NO Problem
24/9/27 AM 8:22 - 국일 Kim: super duper
24/9/27 AM 8:22 - 국일 Kim: thanks!
24/9/27 AM 8:22 - Ramaju Das: Ok sir …. Only request pre- sling
24/9/27 AM 8:25 - 국일 Kim: Since the HCS must be lifted one bundle at at time, pre-sling is un-applicable.
24/9/27 AM 8:26 - 국일 Kim: how about placing the webbing sling set on the trailers?
24/9/27 AM 8:26 - Ramaju Das: That also ok sir … but sling must be there for offloading
24/9/27 AM 8:27 - 국일 Kim: noted
24/9/27 AM 8:32 - 국일 Kim: there is a more more thing.
24/9/27 AM 8:34 - 국일 Kim: when unloading the HCS using the webbing sling, please use a spreader bar to hook it on both edges of HCS in a basket like. <This message was edited>
24/9/27 AM 8:34 - 국일 Kim: This method is safer and will expedite the progress.
24/9/27 AM 8:38 - Ramaju Das: We don’t have spreader bar at site sir…. With belt we can make a basket type for offloading
24/9/27 AM 8:38 - 국일 Kim: ok
24/9/27 AM 8:39 - 국일 Kim: if it is not available, we will have to manage without it.

24/9/27 AM 8:40 - Jhysn: Copy boss
24/9/27 AM 8:41 - Ramaju Das: Only one concern sir … if there have enough wooden packing then ok… other wise it’s chance to broken on offloading time
24/9/27 AM 8:41 - Ramaju Das: Last time TROJAN HCS damage because of same reason
24/9/27 AM 8:42 - 국일 Kim: 이 메시지는 삭제되었습니다

25/1/2 AM 9:16 - 국일 Kim: @⁨Khemlal-SCT Logistics⁩ @⁨Ramaju Das⁩  Please urgently return the lashing belts that were sent
25/1/2 AM 9:32 - Khemlal-SCT Logistics: SIR, we have the last 3 bundles webbing slings the rest already sent...
25/1/2 AM 11:03 - DaN: Dear Mr. @⁨CHA⁩ ,

Please be informed that box no. 13OP-03028.P.01 1129 found damage at the bottom of box. We cannot provide picture of cargo due to non availability of camera..

Take note also that removal of DG cargoes at site is too risky due to the following:
1. No competent riggers 
2. No proper lifting tools in removing cargoes inside the container.

We kindly request that for future deliveries, the DG cargoes should be stripped 1st by DSV.
25/1/2 AM 11:35 - Nicole (SHU): @⁨국일 Kim⁩ @⁨CHA⁩ delivery of scissor lift arrived at site @ 11:35am. Due to not available of operator Unloading will start at 13:30pm
25/1/2 PM 12:18 - DaN: Dear sirs, 

Please be informed that offloading stopped due to damaged cargoes and breaktime of our manpower
Resumed at 1300hours.
25/1/2 PM 12:20 - DaN: Dear @⁨국일 Kim⁩ @⁨CHA⁩ ,

In addition, please be informed that we didn't offload the 7 trailers with cable trays.
This is due to lack of information of cargoes loaded in trailers.
25/1/2 PM 1:06 - 국일 Kim: resumed?
25/1/2 PM 1:08 - 국일 Kim: ??
25/1/2 PM 1:35 - DaN: Resumed
25/1/2 PM 1:36 - DaN: Sorry for the delayed response. Still finding a solution in stripping DG cargoes inside container
25/1/2 PM 1:38 - 국일 Kim: it's okay. is the reason for the destuffing delay bcs cargo is damaged ?
25/1/2 PM 1:43 - DaN: That's the number 1 reason. We cannot easily pull out the boxes due to the damaged bottom part.

No. 2 is incompetent riggers.

3. Insufficient lifting devices.
25/1/2 PM 1:46 - DaN: Much better sir that all cargo should be strip at DSV 1st to avoid this kind of delays..

Please assist us in regards with this matter sir
25/1/2 PM 1:52 - 국일 Kim: noted
25/1/2 PM 2:05 - DaN: Most of the box bottom support was removed and damaged.
Maybe the port loader was forced and press the cargo.
25/1/2 PM 2:06 - DaN: We are now doing our best to offload these cargoes
25/1/2 PM 2:06 - DaN: Patience is a must
25/1/2 PM 2:06 - 국일 Kim: Despite the many challenges in destuffing the containerlized DG cargoes, please support us to ensure  this task is handled smoothly. while we are exploring various options for stripping in AUH before release them to the site.
25/1/2 PM 2:09 - 국일 Kim: Attach the slings to the wooden box body and pull. if the lower support breaks, request reinforcement Civil team
25/1/2 PM 3:01 - DaN: We are doing our best to destuff the materials especially these DG cargoes. Despite of lack of competent manpower and lifting tools.

Please be informed that the DG cargo offloading works are completed.
25/1/2 PM 3:27 - 국일 Kim: @⁨Arvin⁩ Pls address this issues promptly to Siemens and complain
regarding Sim-0021 
1) wooden pkgss were positioned with the fork pocket facing the container wall, making forklift acess impossible
2) The boxes werer stuffed in the wrong direction at the origin, casing damage to the bottom part of the boxes
3) Additional damage occured to the bottom of the wooden boxes s while pulling them out of the container at site. <This message was edited>

25/6/10 PM 4:23 - Khemlal-SCT Logistics: Offloading started
25/6/10 PM 4:25 - 국일 Kim: @⁨Samuel⁩  It's been reported that the weight measured at Shuweihat is: 
1) Container: 3 tons, 
2) Two lifting bodies: 5 tons, 
3) Box: 3 tons, 
========================
totaling 11 tons.
25/6/10 PM 4:32 - 국일 Kim: @⁨Haitham⁩  With the container weighing 3 tons and the two lifting bodies weighing 5 tons, that's a total of 8 tons. 
A 40ft flat rack container will certainly be able to accommodate that weight.  
so the 3 boxes will need to be transferred to a different CCU (Cargo Carrying Unit) for transport.
25/6/10 PM 4:38 - 국일 Kim: Please push the ALS lifting team to send their official advice via email by tomorrow morning.

3) Manifest Number Issuance and Notification
Tadweer issues a Manifest Number based on the uploaded data.
The Manifest Number is then notified to Alphamed (the waste management contractor).

4) Upload to Tamm System and Final Manifest Issuance
Alphamed uploads the Manifest number with details to the Tamm system and issues the final manifest.
Alphamed then proceeds with collection and proper disposal of the waste.

I have confirmed that the above procedure is being followed; however, it has been observed that there are recurring omissions in steps 3 and 4 of the process.
25/8/8 AM 8:17 - DaN: well noted sir.

Thanks!
25/8/8 AM 8:18 - 국일 Kim: Additionally, it has been identified that the account created by the PCM team is being used redundantly across DAS, AGI, and other projects in UAE for waste disposal management, which appears to be contributing to delays in the workflow.
25/8/8 AM 8:22 - 국일 Kim: Please inform the PCM team that due to Alphamed’s slow processing, the waste containers are not being disposed of promptly and therefore remain unused, causing a significant decrease in the turnover rate. 
In light of this, we kindly request the creation of a dedicated account exclusively for HVDC to improve operational efficiency and avoid further delays.
25/8/8 AM 8:22 - DaN: Duly noted sir and will follow it accordingly.

3 x head engines with 3 x FB tails and 2 x A-frame trailers in port / Yard / Site operation. 
For the wall panel discharging and shifting operations, an additional 1 x head engine and 1 x A-frame trailer would help shorten the operation time and enable an earlier vessel turnaround.

It has been confirmed that the operator from Johnson Arabia for the 700-ton crane loaded on Jopetwil 62 has not yet arrived at AGI Island.
The operator’s expected arrival date in AGI is confirmed to be 10 August.

Currently, JPT 62 is anchored offshore. 
As East Harbor (LOLO) operations are possible but West Harbor (RORO) for 700T crane is not, we will proceed with ship-back.
25/8/8 PM 5:55 - 국일 Kim: For reference, although several crane operators are stationed at AGI, it has been confirmed that none of them are qualified to operate the 700-ton crane.
25/8/8 PM 7:14 - 국일 Kim: Out of the total 23 wall panels, 16 panels have been discharged, and the remaining 7 panels are expected to be discharged by this evening.
25/8/8 PM 7:16 - 국일 Kim: This has been reported to Site Manager Barky, and Joon-Tae Kim will follow up on this arrangement  accordingly.

I'm trying sent basket with forklift but no jetty space at East Harbor, full of inbound shipment.

25/8/29 PM 6:15 - Khemlal-SCT Logistics: Dear SCT team

Please find below a request from the drilling team regarding the food waste container located near their office.
The current placement is causing unpleasant odors, making it difficult for the team to maintain a comfortable working environment.
We kindly request that the container be either relocated or that appropriate measures be taken to control the odor.
Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Good Morning Moorthy,

We have observed that the waste CCUs currently located behind our new offices are causing an unpleasant odor in the area. To maintain a healthy and comfortable working environment, we kindly request that these units be relocated to a more suitable location.
Please note that we have previously relocated the Green Mountain team due to a similar issue. We would appreciate your support in relocating the current CCUs from this location as well.

Thanks,
Omar
